			<h2>About the Project</h2>
			<p>
			Adolescence is a critical age for mental health, as half of lifetime diagnosable mental health disorders start by age 14. Depression and anxiety, in particular, occur at high rates in adolescence, and are highly comorbid. Despite major advances, psychiatric care for these disorders is still hampered by the difficulty in predicting which treatment will work for which patient based on conventional diagnostic methods. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In response to such challenges, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has recently introduced <em>Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)</em>, a novel approach to classifying mental disorders based on behavioral and neurobiological measures. Rather than constricting biological research by conventional DSM-V clinical diagnostic groupings, RDoC posits a matrix of functional dimensions that map onto brain systems at multiple levels of analysis, including behavior and brain circuits. The present study will use the cutting-edge MRI protocols developed by the HCP (Human Connectome Project) to map the brain circuits associated with the threat and reward domains of the RDoC. The goal is to determine whether MRI biomarkers that characterize these brain circuits can be used to predict clinical outcome for adolescents with depression and anxiety disorders with greater accuracy than that of conventional diagnostic tools.

			<strong>Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders at Boston University (BU):</strong> The Child and Adolescent Fear and Anxiety Treatment Program is part of the Center for Anxiety and Related Disorders (CARD) at Boston University. CARD, founded by David H. Barlow, Ph.D., is an internationally known center for the assessment, treatment, and scientific investigation of anxiety and related disorders in individuals aged 3-65, and is one of the largest research clinics of its type in the world. The Child and Adolescent Fear and Anxiety Treatment Program, previously located at the State University of New York at Albany, has been in operation in Boston for the past 17 years, and Dr. Donna Pincus, Associate Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, has been directing the Child Program for the past 15+ years. The Child Program at CARD is an interdisciplinary research and treatment program devoted to expanding and improving the quality and accessibility of evidence based mental health care for young children and their families. The Child Program at CARD provides state of the art treatment for children aged 3-17 with anxiety disorders and related mood disorders, and maintains a substantial patient flow due to its well-established clinical infrastructure. We have assessed and treated almost 1,000 children over the past 7 years. The program is experiencing increased growth and referrals, now occurring at an average rate of 35 per month and rising. The Child Program has received both local/national media attention for its grant supported research programs for youth and their families. We expect referrals to continue to rise, due in part to scheduled local and national publicity, our continual recruitment efforts, and our positive reputation in the community. Under Dr. Pincus’ direction, the Child Program now supports a clinical director (David Langer, Ph.D.), as well as 2 staff psychologists and two postdoctoral fellows. Child CARD faculty are all actively involved in research and also train students, interns, and practicum trainees to deliver state of the art assessment and treatment protocols to youth with anxiety disorders and their families. The Child Program at CARD also has a large group of undergraduate and master’s-level research assistants who assist with clinical activities and provide research support. Faculty from Child CARD have successfully implemented numerous clinical trials with adolescents with a range of disorders.

			<strong>Child CBT program at the MGH:</strong> This is a Harvard Medical School-affiliated major medical center serving the entire New England area. The Child CBT program, which serves children ages 3-24 years receives 10-20 referrals per week, with the vast majority of referrals being for anxiety. Children will also be recruited from among those presenting to the general child outpatient psychiatry department at MGH. The outpatient psychiatric clinics register 30,000 visits per year, and evaluate more than 200 new patients per month. All social class strata and ethnic and racial groups are represented in the MGH patient population, and the study will not exclude any participants on the basis of race, ethnicity, social background or gender. This group has successfully met enrollment targets for past grants and, given our large catchment area and ongoing clinical efforts in childhood anxiety, we are well positioned to recruit the proposed sample.

			<strong>McLean Hospital:</strong> McLean Hospital (McLean) is a comprehensive mental health care system committed to providing a full range of high quality, cost effective, mental health services to patients, their families and the larger community. The Hospital is dedicated to training mental health professionals, to supporting basic and clinical research to understand the causes of mental illnesses, and to developing effective new means for prevention and treatment. Since 1811, McLean has been a world leader in the treatment of mental illness, research on mental illnesses, and in training generations of mental health care providers. McLean is an affiliate of MGH and a member of the Partners HealthCare System, Inc., which allows for comprehensive coordination of medical and psychiatric services. A major teaching facility of Harvard Medical School, McLean maintains the largest program of research in neuroscience and psychiatry of any private psychiatric hospital in the US. Presently, Dr. Auerbach is the Director of Clinical Research for the Division of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Dr. Auerbach has worked in collaboration with adolescent-based clinical units on campus to utilize clinical research to inform treatment. Since beginning these collaborative projects in 2012, Dr. Auerbach has enrolled over 400 depressed adolescents (with similar inclusion criteria as this proposed study) for ongoing projects from short-term, insurance-based adolescent residential programs on McLean’s campus.

<h2>Study Procedure</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
				Study visit 1 will occur at any one of the three clinical sites (BU, MGH, McLean). It will involve participant clinical characterization, including evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, as well as administration of the NIH toolbox behavioral tasks and additional HCP behavioral tasks. 
				</li>
<br>
				<li>
				Study visit 2 will occur at the MGH Martinos Center. It will involve administration of behavioral measures of attention bias, and the HCP imaging protocol (structural, diffusion-weighted, resting-state, and task-based functional MRI). We will use a mock scanner to allow subjects to get acclimated to the MRI environment before scanning.
				</li>
<br>
				<li>
				The 2 study visits will occur within two weeks. After the study visits are completed, the subjects will be asked to complete follow-up clinical assessments at 6 and 12 months after study visit 2. In particular, self-report questionnaires will be administered online at 6 months, and clinical interviews will be conducted at 12 months in person during an on-site visit.
				</li>	
			</ul>
			<h2>Scan Data Harmonization</h2>
<p>
<strong>Task-based fMRI (tfMRI):</strong> We will compare the time-series signal-to-noise ratio (TSNR) between sites. We will test for site differences in the activation maps from each task.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Resting-state fMRI (rfMRI):</strong> We will compare the TSNR between sites. We will test for site differences in correlation, partial-correlation, regularized correlation maps; time-series power spectra; and group network maps. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Structural MRI (sMRI):</strong> The sMRI scans will be processed with FreeSurfer to extract cortical surface reconstructions, cortical parcellations, and subcortical segmentations. We will test for site differences in FreeSurfer-derived measures, such as cortical thickness, surface area of cortical regions, and volume of subcortical structures.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI):</strong> We will process the dMRI scans with TRActs Constrained by UnderLying Anatomy (TRACULA), our fully automated method for reconstructing major WM pathways. We will test for site differences in anisotropy and diffusivity measures obtained from each pathway. We will perform these tests both for average measures over an entire pathway, as well as at different cross-sections along a pathway. We will also compare the estimated diffusion orientations, as derived by fitting the orientation distribution function (ODF) or FSL’s ball-and-stick model.
